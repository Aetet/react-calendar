Current version: [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-browserify.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-browserify)\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com) `~0.4.0` and Node `>=0.10.x`.\n\nInstall this grunt plugin with:\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-browserify --save-dev\n```\n\nThen add this line to your project's `grunt.js` Gruntfile:\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-browserify');\n```\n\n## In the Wild\nMost simply, Browserify is a tool for taking your CommonJS-style Javascript\ncode and packaging it for use in the browser. Grunt-Browserify provides the\nglue to better integrate Browserify into your development workflow.\n\nFor JavaScripters unfamiliar with CJS-style code and the Node ecosystem, moving\nto Browserify can be a bit confusing. Writing your client-side code as CJS\nmodules allows for smaller, easier to understand files that perform one task\nwell. These modules, because of their simplicity, will be significantly easier\nto use across projects. CJS modules also help to expose the dependency graph\ninherent in your code, allowing you to write cleaner, more-maintainable\nmodules. As [Alex MacCaw writes](http://spinejs.com/docs/commonjs):\n>CommonJS modules are one of the best solutions to JavaScript dependency\n>management.\n\n>CommonJS modules solve JavaScript scope issues by making sure each module is\n>executed in its own namespace. Modules have to explicitly export variables\n>they want to expose to other modules, and explicitly import other modules; in\n>other words, there's no global namespace.\n\n(A note to AMD fans that the benefits above are not unique to the CJS\nstyle of writing JavaScript modules, but the ease-of-interoperality with\nNode.JS code is a plus of CJS.)\n\nAs you begin to write your client-side code in small, reusable modules, you\nstart to have a lot more files to manage. At the same time, you need to\nintegrate these files with other client-side libraries, some of which do not\nplay particularly nicely with a CJS module system. The simplicity provided by\nCJS modules can be lost as build complexity is increased and Browserify\ncompilation time gets out of control.\n\nGrunt-Browserify is here to make your life easier. There's a number of examples\nprovided in the `examples` directory of different real-world uses of\nGrunt-Browserify. Those examples, plus the example of the project's own\nGruntfile, should provide clarity into how to get started. This project's\nauthor and contributors are happy to answer any specific questions on Twitter.\n\nIn addition to the examples mentioned above, there are some specific pieces of advice that\nmay prove helpful:\n\n* Be careful with entry modules. Entry modules are any files passed directly to Browserify's\n`require` method. Anything specified in Grunt-Browserify's `src` will be interpreted as an entry file.\nKeep in mind that Browserify walks a dependency tree, so theoretically a single\n\"main\" entry file could be enough for all of your client side code. The reason\nfor caution is that entry files are interpretted at *load time*, unlike\ntraditionally required modules, which are interpretted like any CJS module -\nwhen they are required. Anything in an entry file is run as soon as the\nBrowserified bundle is loaded on a web page. See the inline comments in the\n`simple` example directory for further details.\n\n* Break vendored libs into their own Browserify build. Libs like jQuery, Angular, D3, etc. are large files that can\ngreatly slow down Browserify compilation time. They also aren't changing with the same frequency\nas your own client source code. By breaking these vendored files into their own Grunt-Browserify\ntask, then making them externally available via an alias, you can make build\ntimes signficantly shorter. See the `complex` example folder for a use case.\nYou can concatenate each Browserified bundled to a single JS file, which\nshould handle any concerns with browser latency.\n\n* Transforms are your friend. You can perform some pretty complex magic with\nBrowserify-transforms. Check out [deamdify](https://github.com/jaredhanson/deamdify)\nand [coffeeify](https://github.com/substack/coffeeify) for some useful\nexamples.\n\n* The more modular the code, the more likely you are to share modules across\nclient and server. Grunt-Browserify can help you manage the complexity around\nkeeping your client-side code in different folder paths. (For example,\n`client/script` and `shared`.) Take a look at the `aliasMappings` capability,\nwhich also has a corresponding setup in the examples folder.\n\n\n## Documentation\nRun this task with the `grunt browserify` command. As with other Grunt plugins, the `src` and `dest` properties are most important: `src` will use the Grunt glob pattern to specify files for inclusion in the browserified package, and `dest` will specify the outfile for the compiled module.\n\n### Options\n#### ignore\nType: `[String]`\n\nSpecifies files to be ignored in the browserify bundle.\n\n#### noParse\nType: `[String]`\n\nArray of file paths that Browserify should not attempt to parse for `require()`\nstatements, which should improve compilation time for large library files that\ndo not need to be parsed. (The Browserify docs provide the example of jQuery, although I\nthink it would probably be more useful to shim such libraries than to compile\nthem with noParse).\n\n#### alias\nType: `[String:String]` or comma-separated `String`\n\nBrowserify can alias files or modules to a certain name. For example, `require(‘./foo’)`\ncan be aliased to be used as `require(‘foo’)`. Aliases should be specified as\n`fileName:alias`.  A couple notes:\n\n* fileNames are parsed into their full paths with `path.resolve`.\n\n* Any aliases are automatically externalized by Browserify. That means an alias in one bundle is requireable from another.\n\n* If you leave the second half of an alias blank, it will just externalize the target. For example: `alias: ['events:']` will\nalias the events module as 'events' inside and outside of the bundle.\n\n#### aliasMappings\nType: `[Object || Array]`\n\nLike the `alias` option described above, but accepts mapping patterns as described in [Building the files object dynamically](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#building-the-files-object-dynamically) to enable aliasing of entire\ndirectories and sets of files. Note that the `expand` option is set to `true` for you,\nso you can omit that from your configuration.\n\n#### external\nType: `[String]`\n\nSpecifies files to be loaded from a previously loaded, “common” bundle.\n\n\n#### transform\nType: `[String || Function]`\n\nSpecifies a pipeline of functions (or modules) through which the browserified bundle will be run. The [browserify docs themselves](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#btransformopts-tr) explain transform well, but below is an example of transform used with `grunt-browserify` to automatically compile coffeescript files for use in a bundle:\n\n```javascript\nbrowserify: {\n  dist: {\n    files: {\n      'build/module.js': ['client/scripts/**/*.js', 'client/scripts/**/*.coffee'],\n    },\n    options: {\n      transform: ['coffeeify']\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### debug\nType: `Boolean`\n\nEnable source map support.\n\n#### shim\nType: `Object`\n\nProvide a config object to be used with\n[browserify-shim v2.0](https://github.com/thlorenz/browserify-shim/tree/v2.0.10).\nNote that shimmed modules are essentially `alias`ed as well (with the alias\nbeing the Object key of the shim).\n\n#### preBundleCB\nType: `Function (b)`\n\nAn optional callback function, that will be called before bundle completion.\n`b` is the `browerify` instance that will output the bundle.\n\n#### postBundleCB\nType: `Function (err, src, next)`\n\nAn optional callback function, which will be called after bundle completion and\nbefore writing of the bundle. The `err` and `src` arguments are provided\ndirectly from browserify. The `next` callback should be called with `(err,\nmodifiedSrc)`; the `modifiedSrc` is what will be written to the output file.\n\n#### Other Options\n\nAny other options you provide will be passed through to browserify. This is useful for setting things like `standalone` or `ignoreGlobals`.\n\n###Usage\nTo get things running, add the following entry to `grunt.initConfig()`:\n\n```javascript\nbrowserify: {\n  dist: {\n    files: {\n      'build/module.js': ['client/scripts/**/*.js']\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nMore complicated use cases can be found within this projects own `Gruntfile`.\n\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
